                        <p>My interest lies with the power art has on humanity and the way it
                            intertwines with culture
                            to leave lasting impressions. I was introduced to design when I took my first
                            humanities
                            class
                            in high school and developed an eye for form, function, and aesthetics in architecture
                            and art. My
                            interest
                            in
                            art also includes music, culinary, and martial arts. I
                            appreciate
                            the
                            way art is expressed
                            through different mediums and am always looking for inspiration.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="about-me2">
                        <p> I started my career in risk consulting which was a great
                            experience to connect with
                            others to solve client problems. My job was to speak to and gather data from clients,
                            analyze the data, and provide
                            solutions for their concerns. Although, I enjoyed working with clients to understand their
                            problems, I felt frustrated
                            that I only provided solutions, but did not have the tools to create the solutions. I
                            transitioned to a technology
                            start-up as a Program Manager where I learned how to work cross-functionally
                            in a
                            fast-paced environment.
                            This brought me closer to my interests in the art of technology, but I was still lacking the
                            ability to create something. It wasn't until I discovered designing a good user experience,
                            that I
                            could see how cohesive
                            technology, art, and design worked together. I saw the potential growth and was inspired by
                            this
                            new art form.
                        </p>

                    <div class="about-me3">
                        <p>Whether it is creating a pleasing layout or an intuitive form that can save time, I found
                            myself
                            excited to finally
                            create solutions to problems that were meaningful and had intention. With many years of
                            experience both in the business
                            and the tech world, I can bring my ability to work with clients and understanding of
                            technology
                            to use design as a way
                            to create value to people.</p>
