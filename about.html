                <h1>A little about me</h1>
                <p>I’m Christine! I live in Austin, TX and currentely immersing myself into the world of design. I’m
                    eager to learn,
                    create, and innovate with people to develop valuable experiences.</p>

                <div class="about-me1">
                    <p>I remember the feeling of being enthralled with the power art had on humanity and the way it
                        intertwines with culture
                        while leaving lasting impressions. I was introduced to design when I took my first humanities
                        class
                        in high school where
                        I developed a keen eye for form, function, and aesthetics in architecture and art. My interest
                        in
                        the arts doesn't stop
                        at just the visual arts, but also includes music, culinary, and even martial arts. I appreciate
                        the
                        way art permeates
                        through different mediums and am always looking for inspirations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="about-me2">
                    <p> Non-traditionally, I started my career in risk consulting which looking back was a great
                        experience to connect with
                        others to solve client problems. My job was to speak to and gather data from the clients,
                        analyze the data, and provide
                        solutions for their concerns. Although, I enjoyed working with clients to understand their
                        problems, I felt frustrated
                        that I only provided solutions, but did not have the tools to create the solutions. I
                        transitioned to a technology
                        start-up in Austin, TX as a Program Manager where I learned how to work cross-functionally in a
                        fast-paced environment.
                        This brought me closer to my interests in the art of technology, but I was still lacking the
                        ability to create something
                        that I could be proud. It wasn't until I discovered designing a good user experience, that I
                        could see how cohesive
                        technology, art, and design worked together. I saw the potential growth and was inspired by this
                        new art form.

                <div class="about-me3">
                    <p>Whether it is creating a pleasing layout or an intuitive form that can save time, I found myself
                        excited to finally
                        create solutions to problems that were meaningful and had intention. With many years of
                        experience both in the business
                        and the tech world, I can bring my ability to work with clients and understanding of technology
                        to use design as a way
                        to speak to and motivate people.</p>
