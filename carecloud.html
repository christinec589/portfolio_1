                        in
                        some cases, been a
                        barrier for medical professionals to complete their work. This project gave me the opportunity
                        to
                        tackle this barrier.</p>

                                information making it unclear with a lack of scannability. When thereâ€™s that kind of

                        testing the prototype, it helped me realize which process wasnâ€™t fully developed and where we

                        to redesign. I
                        conducted usability testing on the completed wireframes and redesigns from testing results

                            chosen, Lora and Lato, are simple and have a certain roundness that give a sense of openness

                            care. The color palette includes a Dark Blue that contrasts with the Periwinkle and the

                            grey,
                            which adds a level of calmness, while remaining professional looking. The logo was a result

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This project gave me opportunities to assess areas of improvement. More of the survey questions could
                    have been specific
                    to the current medical record systems used by the participants and exact areas in the interface that
                    needed revision.
                    Instead of looking at general pain points among medical professionals, getting more specific answers
                    could have driven
                    the solution to be more useful.</p>
                <p>
                    This project also gave me the insight into the healthcare industry that I was not expecting. As such
                    a
                    research heavy
                    and highly advanced field, it lacked the user research and user experience focus needed to build
                    tools
                    and apps that
                    would support the medical professionals in maximizing their time with patients. If given the
                    opportunity, I would would
                    love to gather more data and feedback by shadowing medical professionals to truly capture how each
                    tool
                    is used and can
                    be improved upon based on each professionalâ€™s workflow. The ability to go beyond just looking at
                    individual tools and
                    look at the bigger picture of the UX ecosystem in healthcare could provide an even bigger impact on
                    addressing pain
                    points and gaps for medical professionals and patients.
